Hey, I am a Computer Science student at Northeastern University. I am passionate about continuously learning about software development, but more importantly, the impact I can have on people. Utilizing my skills to improve lives is the true meaning of the work I aim to do, which is why we are creating our application. Best Life is an application that aims to support individuals in making decisions to improve their well-being. It includes helping students decide on countries best suited to their needs and educational priorities, assisting policymakers in identifying areas of concern to pursue and aiding environmental activists in maximizing their impact.
