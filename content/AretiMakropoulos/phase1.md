# Phase 1 Project Contributions

In the Phase 1 deliverable, I contributed through the brainstorming process, helping to find an idea we are passionate about pursuing to build an application to address the problem. We discussed many different international government related problems before honing in on the quality of life in European Union countries. I helped develop the project description and overview of the three user personas for our application, adapting and changing after discussions with the Professors and TA. I aided the team in incorporating feedback by clarifying our personas' goals when interacting with our application. I wrote many of the personas and user stories that captured the value our project has for them. I also helped find the APIs we will use in the project. 

## Experiences

My Dialogue of Civilizations in Belgium has been extremely enriching in the classroom and outside. In CS 3200 with Dr. Fontenot, I have been able to learn more about Database Management Systems, with a focus on RDBMS, as we work with MySQL and apply our SQL skills. Additionally, it has been a pleasure bouncing ideas back and forth with these brilliant minds and finding our passion for this project. I look forward to working with them more and cannot wait for the next steps in our project! 

Outside the classroom, visits to NATO, the European Parliament, and the European Commission have profoundly contributed to my understanding of the European Union and international government. Interacting with the speakers has facilitated a healthy conversation regarding the EU and NATO's role in current events.
