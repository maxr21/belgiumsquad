# Contributions

- Implemented the Cosine similarities score model on the Policy Maker's "Similar Countries" page and on Grace's "Country Recommendations Map" page

- debugged cosine similarity scores model. Originally it only took as input numbers between 1 and 100 however this was not usable for Policy Maker's similar countries so I rewrote the model to take in standardised scores and used the inverse sigmoid and relativisation scores within the Prospective University Student's page.

- Debugged issues with converting the score input from the sliders into standardised scores. There were bugs in making the scores relative to eachother.

- Built the Policy and Similar Countries pages for the Policy Maker.

- General clean up. E.g. writing explanatory blurbs for the users, removing deprecation messages, cleaning all unused routes and code.

# Enjoyable fun activites

Unfortunately I caught ill towards the end of the week and couldn't attend as many activities as I wanted to but I was able to go to C-mine, the old coal mine in Genk. It was really cool seeing how impressive the engineering was behind these massive mines.
