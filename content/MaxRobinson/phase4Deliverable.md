# Contributions

- Implemented the Cosine similarities score model on the Policy Maker's "Similar Countries" page and on Grace's "Country Recommendations Map" page

- debugged cosine similarity scores model. Originally it only took as input numbers between 1 and 100 however this was not usable for Policy Maker's similar countries so I rewrote the model to take in standardised scores and used the inverse sigmoid and relativisation scores within the Prospective University Student's page.

- Debugged issues with converting the score input from the sliders into standardised scores. There were bugs in making the scores relative to eachother.

- Built the Policy and Similar Countries pages for the Policy Maker.

- General clean up. E.g. writing explanatory blurbs for the users, removing deprecation messages, cleaning all unused routes and code.

# Enjoyable fun activites

Unfortunately I caught ill towards the end of the week and couldn't attend as many activities as I wanted to but I was able to go to C-mine, the old coal mine in Genk. It was really cool seeing how impressive the engineering was behind these massive mines. Also very sad to hear about the conditions for the workers.
