Discussion/description of individual contributions to Phase
III deliverable. Examples:

- What parts of the ML model (training/testing/model
  checking) did you contribute to?
- Which screens did you contribute to and in what way?
- Feel free to add a program-related section at the end of
  your individual post to mention any meaningful things
  outside of the project that you recall from the past week.

I created the Cosine similarity scores model and integrated it into the web app. I Debugged the issues we had with querying the wrong database and then debugged further issues with incorrect data formats and jsonifying a json file. I then debugged more issues had with communicating with the API. The post json was incorrectly formatted and it was due to three missing character. The characters were ", 0]".

I created Faye's map similarity page and implemented the model for Grace's map similarity scores page.
For both these pages I added the chloropleth map showing more similar countries in a darker blue and less similar countries in lighter shades.

### Luxembourg trip

The trip of the week was one to Luxembourg where we stayed for 3 nights. I enjoyed watching the annual midnight marathon, watching the Champions league final and visiting the Bedessee lake. Luxembourg was a very interesting city. There was lots of beautiful nature and ancient city architecture that was fascinating to walk among.
