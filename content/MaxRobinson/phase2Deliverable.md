# My Contributions to the project

- Webscraped 5 different websites to grab the top three news headlines, dates and hyperlinks. Displayed these as a list of dictionaries with datetime objects.
  - scraped environment, education, health, transport and culture EU news sites.
- began the API cleaning framework, wrote the api getters.
- designed and wrote the cosine similarity scores model and the inverse sigmoid translation.
- designed the Autoregression model to be used to predict future QoL scores.

My favourite trip this last week was the one to Namur. I found it really interesting speaking to the locals in French and learning about the city. Even more relevant, and interesting, was learning about the history of computers at the museum of computers in Namur. We had a terrific guide that took us from the first computers used for census data collection in the U.S to Burrough's machines and then to modern day computers.
