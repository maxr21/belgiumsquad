# About Max

Currently a rising Junior at Northeastern University studying CS and Maths. I grew up Acton, London until I moved two years ago to Oakland, CA and then to Boston, MA to study as a Global Scholar at Northeastern. I started coding so that I could make video games because as a kid I loved playing Minecraft but had personal disagreements with some features. After making many, many games, I learnt that I most enjoyed coding when it involved maths for example, making the graphics for my games and working with physics engines. I also naturally developed an interest in Machine Learning and AI because it is a natural combination of my two favourite subjects, Computer Science and Maths.
